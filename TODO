test on py 3.x

build py extension on windows

is there a unit test that also covers extended langs?

add test case for binary data, empty string, etc.

hmm why only null generated ./encodings/compact_lang_det/generated/compact_lang_det_generated_cjkbis_0.cc?  others have null (_0) and non-null versions?

make thread stress test

remove dead files

memory leak...?

am i sure no unicode normalization was done...?  what about NFC normalization for the UChar* API (in cld_unicodetext.cc)?

return list of all detectable langs
  - hmm should be lang + script?

Jehan's TODO list
=================

- API man files for both C++ and Python.
- simple "one file" C++ include.
- Check last commits upstream that have not been included yet and merge if needed.

- Make better C++ check test (Note: Google original code has some unit test files. Probably they can be adapted).

- Make a static deb package?
- Make .rpm and .ebuild packages?
- Do we want to have binary packaged for the python binding? Or rather pip packages only?

- Improve release/debian/* for upstream inclusion of deb packages.

- [if time] Read the whole code, clean it, improve if needed.
- [if time] Try to understand how the detection data is generated and check if we cannot make a tool to generate additional data to improve
  detection (using Free text data, for instance on Wikipedia, etc.).

- cld needs UTF-8 input. Would be nice to have a good encoding detection library to go with it (for conversion, iconv exists, but it does
  not detect as far as I know).
